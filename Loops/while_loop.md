A while loop in Java is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true.

It checks the condition before executing the loop body, making it an entry-controlled loop.

Example :

class WhileLoopDemo 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
     

        }
    }
}
