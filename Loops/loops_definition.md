A loop in Java is a control structure that allows a block of code to be executed repeatedly as long as a condition is true. Once the condition becomes false, the loop stops. Loops help in writing clean and efficient programs by avoiding code repetition.

● To handle unknown or large data – e.g., reading 1000 numbers, iterating over arrays, or traversing lists.

● To improve code readability and efficiency – makes programs shorter and easier to maintain.

● To apply logic systematically – like calculating sums, factorials, or executing algorithms step by step.

● To perform automation in programs – loops make execution dynamic instead of static.


Start → Check Condition → Execute Block → Update → Repeat until condition becomes false.

There are four main types of loops in java -
