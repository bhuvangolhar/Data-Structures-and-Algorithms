**Definition of a Loop:**

A **loop** in Java is a fundamental control flow statement that allows a programmer to execute a block of code **repeatedly** 
as long as a particular condition remains true. Instead of writing the same set of statements multiple times, loops make it 
possible to automate repetitive tasks efficiently.

Loops help in situations where a certain operation needs to be performed multiple times — for example, processing elements 
in an array, displaying a series of numbers, or performing calculations until a condition is met.

Each loop consists of **three main components**:

1. **Initialization** – sets the starting point (e.g., initializing a counter variable).
   
2. **Condition** – determines whether the loop will continue or terminate; the loop runs as long as
                   this condition evaluates to true.
   
3. **Iteration/Update** – changes the loop control variable to move toward the termination condition
                          (e.g., incrementing or decrementing a counter).

When the condition becomes false, the loop stops executing, and the program continues with the next statement after the 
loop. Using loops makes the code shorter, cleaner, and easier to maintain, and it significantly improves performance 
when dealing with repetitive operations or large data sets.

**Main types of loops in Java:**

i) **for loop** – Executes a block of code a fixed number of times, typically when the number of iterations is known.

ii) **while loop** – Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.

iii) **do-while loop** – Similar to the while loop but ensures the code block executes at least once before
                           checking the condition.
                           
iv) **for-each loop OR enhanced for loop** – Used to traverse arrays or collections easily without managing indexes manually.
