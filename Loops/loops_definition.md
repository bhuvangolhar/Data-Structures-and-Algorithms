● To handle unknown or large data – e.g., reading 1000 numbers, iterating over arrays, or traversing lists.

● To improve code readability and efficiency – makes programs shorter and easier to maintain.

● To apply logic systematically – like calculating sums, factorials, or executing algorithms step by step.

● To perform automation in programs – loops make execution dynamic instead of static.

Start → Check Condition → Execute Block → Update → Repeat until condition becomes false.
