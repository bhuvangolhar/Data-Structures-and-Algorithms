A do-while loop in Java executes a block of code at least once, and then keeps repeating it as long as the given condition is true.

It is an exit-controlled loop, because the condition is checked after executing the loop body.

Used when you want the code to run at least once, even if the condition is false.

while (condition);


Example :

class DoWhileLoopDemo 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        int num = 1;
        do 
        {
     
        } 
    
}
