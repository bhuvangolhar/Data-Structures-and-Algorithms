**Definition :**

A method in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task.
It is used to group statements together, so they can be executed
whenever the method is called. Methods improve reusability, readability,
and modularity in a program.

**Syntax :**

returnType methodName(parameters)
{
*// method body*
*// statements*
return value; *// if returnType is not void*
}

**Examples :**

int add(int a, int b)
{
return a + b;
}

void greet()
{
System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
}

**Rules :**

→ Must be declared inside a class.
→ Method name should follow Java naming rules (start with lowercase, meaningful name).


▪ Predefined Methods – Already defined in Java libraries (e.g., Math.max(), System.out.println()).
▪ User-defined Methods – Created by the programmer to perform specific tasks.


**Program :**

class MethodsDemo
{

sobj.multiply(5, 4);
System.out.println("Multiplication: " + result);

}

**Output :**

Multiplication: 20
