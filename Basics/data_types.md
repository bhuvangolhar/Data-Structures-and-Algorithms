**Data Types :**

In Java, data types define the type of values a variable can store. Java is a strongly typed language, which means every variable
must have a type declared before use.

Java data types are divided into two categories:

â€¢ *Primitive Da
2.**Non-Primitive Data Types -**

Non-primitive types (also called reference types) are more complex and are redefined and faster.
2) Non-primitive types are created by programmers or provided by Java API.
3) Primitive stores value directly, Non-primitive stores reference (address).
4) Primitive types start with lowercase (int, char), Non-primitive types start with uppercase (String, Array).
