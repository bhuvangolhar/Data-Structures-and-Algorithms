**Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) in Java :**



**Core Concepts of OOPS -**
(methods) that the objects 
(methods) that the objects will have.


5) **Polymorphism :** Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take many forms. It is
                      achieved in Java through method overloading (compile-time) and method
                      overriding (runtime).
                    
6) **Abstraction :** Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only the necessary
                     features of an object. It is implemented in Java using abstract classes
                     and interfaces.
