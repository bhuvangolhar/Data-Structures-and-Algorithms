**Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) in Java :**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which represent real-world entities. These 
encapsulate both data (fields) and behavior (methods), making programs more structured an
Java strongly follows the OOP approach, enabling developers to model real-world problems effectively while keeping the code flexible and organized. Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) in Java is a way of organizing code around objects that combine data and behavior. It makes programs more modular, reusable and easier to 
Java is built on OOP principles, which help in designing efficient and real-world-based solutions.

**Core Concepts of OOPS -**

1) **Object :** An object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world
                entity. It holds its own state (data) and behavior (methods).

2) **Class :** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines
               attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.


5) **Polymorphism :** Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take many forms. It is
                      achieved in Java through method overloading (compile-time) and method
                      overriding (runtime).
                    
6) **Abstraction :** Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only the necessary
                     features of an object. It is implemented in Java using abstract classes
                     and interfaces.
