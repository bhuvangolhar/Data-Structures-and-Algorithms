**Definition of a String :**

A string in Java is a sequence of characters written inside double quotes. It is used to represent text, such as words, sentences, or symbols. For example, "Hello", "12345", 
and "Java Programming" are all strings. Unlike numbers that can be stored in variables of type int or double, text is stored in variables of type String. Strings are one of 
the most commonly used data types in any program because almost every application needs to handle text in some form, whether it is a name, a message, or a user input.

In Java, a string is not just a collection of charactersâ€”it is actually an object of the String class. This means strings come with many useful built-in methods that make it 
two strings together. So instead of writing a lot of code to manipulate text, you can simply use these ready-made methods.
This immutability helps keep strings safe and efficient to use, especially when multiple parts of a 
program are sharing the same text.

These classes are very useful when you need to perform many operations on text, such as repeatedly appending, inserting, or deleting characters. But in most simple cases, using the String class itself is enough. Overall, strings are one of the most essential tools in Java programming, and understanding how they work is important for both basic coding and advanced problem solving.
