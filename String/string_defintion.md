**Definition of a String :**

A string in Java is a sequence of characters written inside double quotes. It is used to represent text, such as words, sentences, or symbols. For example, "Hello", "12345", 
and "Java Programming" are all strings. Unlike numbers that can be stored in variables of type int or double, text is stored in variables of type String. Strings are one of 
the most commonly used data types in any program because almost every application needs to handle text in some form, whether it is a name, a message, or a user input.

In Java, a string is not just a collection of characters—it is actually an object of the String class. This means strings come with many useful built-in methods that make it 
easy to work with text. For example, you can find the length of a string, convert it to uppercase or lowercase, check if it contains a particular word, or even join two strings together. So instead of writing a lot of code to manipulate text, you can simply use these ready-made methods.

Another important point about strings in Java is that they are immutable, which means once a string object is created, it cannot be changed. For example, if you have String 
s = "Hello"; and then change it to s = "World";, Java does not actually modify the original "Hello" string—it creates a new string "World" and makes s point to it. The old 
string still exists in memory until Java’s garbage collector removes it. This immutability helps keep strings safe and efficient to use, especially when multiple parts of a 
program are sharing the same text.

Because strings are immutable, Java also provides special classes like StringBuilder and StringBuffer that allow modification of text without creating new objects each time. 
These classes are very useful when you need to perform many operations on text, such as repeatedly appending, inserting, or deleting characters. But in most simple cases, using the String class itself is enough. Overall, strings are one of the most essential tools in Java programming, and understanding how they work is important for both basic coding and advanced problem solving.
