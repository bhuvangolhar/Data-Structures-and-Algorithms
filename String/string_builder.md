➤ StringBuilder is very similar to StringBuffer but is not thread-safe.

➤ Lack of synchronization makes it faster and more efficient than StringBuffer in single-threaded programs.

➤ Like StringBuffer, it also creates mutable strings that can be changed without making new objects.

➤ It provides methods such as append(), insert(), delete(),, and reverse() for string manipulation.

➤ Faster than both String (immutable) and StringBuffer (synchronized).

➤ Commonly used in loops, handling large text, and joining strings efficiently.

➤ *Example use case -* Building dynamic text like sentences, messages, or logs quickly.
