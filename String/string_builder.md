**StringBuilder in Java :**


➤ StringBuilder is very similar to StringBuffer but is not thread-safe.

➤ Lack of synchronization makes it faster and more efficient than StringBuffer in single-threaded programs.

➤ Like StringBuffer, it also creates mutable strings that can be changed without making new objects.

➤ *Example -* StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Java"); sb.append("Program"); → JavaProgram.

➤ It provides methods such as append(), insert(), delete(), replace(), and reverse() for string manipulation.

➤ Best suited for single-threaded programs where performance is important.

➤ Faster than both String (immutable) and StringBuffer (synchronized).

➤ Commonly used in loops, handling large text, and joining strings efficiently.

➤ *Example use case -* Building dynamic text like sentences, messages, or logs quickly.

➤ *In short -* StringBuilder = mutable + faster than StringBuffer, but not safe for multi-threaded use.
