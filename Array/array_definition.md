An array is one of the most fundamental datstored together in contiguous memory locations. This means that once an array is created, the elements are placed 
Conceptually, an array can be thought of as a sequence or list of elements where each element is identified by a unique index. These indexes act as a direct address to the tematic way of storing and organizing data elements of the same type, allowing efficient access and management. By using indexing, arrays provide a advanced computer science applications. They are widely used because of their speed, structure, and simplicity, and they form the backbone of many algorithms and more complex data structures.
