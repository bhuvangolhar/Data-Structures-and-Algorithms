**Definition:**

• An array in Java is a way to store many values of the same data type (like all integers or all strings) in one variable.

• It helps us manage data easily instead of creating many separate variables for each value.

• The elements of an array are stored in continuous memory locations, one after another.

• Each element in an array has a unique index, which starts from 0 and goes up to length - 1.

• You can access any element quickly using its index number (for example, the first element is at index 0).

• Arrays in Java are objects, which means they are created using the new keyword.

• The size of an array is fixed, meaning once it is created, you cannot add or remove elements from it.

• All the elements in an array must be of the same data type — for example, all integers or all characters.

• Arrays make it easy to perform operations like looping, sorting, and searching on a collection of data.

• They are useful for storing lists of items such as marks of students, names, or numbers in programs efficiently.
